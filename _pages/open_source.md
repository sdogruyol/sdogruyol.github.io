I started contributing to Open Source projects in 2013 and over time I authored, contributed to and helped many libraries and frameworks. This page lists my most notable contributions and projects.

# Kemal

[Kemal](https://kemalcr.com/) is the most popular web framework for Crystal. Its motto is *Fast, Effective, Simple*. I'm the author of Kemal and have been maintaining it since 2015.

# Crystal


[Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) is a programming language with the following goals:

- Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
- Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
- Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
- Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
- Compile to efficient native code.

I'm a Crystal Core Team member since 2018.

# Crystal For Rubyists

[Crystal for Rubyists](https://www.crystalforrubyists.com/) is a free book for people who want to learn Crystal from a dynamic language perspective. I'm the author of this book.

# cryload

[cryload](https://github.com/sdogruyol/cryload) is an HTTP benchmarking tool written in Crystal. I'm the author and maintainer.

# tren

[tren](https://github.com/sdogruyol/tren) lets you use your SQL as a first-class method in your Crystal application. I'm the author.

# fast-http-server

[fast-http-server](https://github.com/sdogruyol/fast-http-server) is a super fast, zero configuration command line HTTP server. I'm the author.
